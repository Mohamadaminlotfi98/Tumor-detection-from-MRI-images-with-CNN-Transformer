# Tumor-detection-from-MRI-images-with-CNN-Transformer

Tumor detection from MRI images with CNN-Transformer is a promising new approach that combines the strengths of two powerful deep learning architectures: convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers.

CNNs have traditionally been the go-to architecture for medical image processing tasks, such as tumor detection and segmentation. They are well-suited for extracting local features from images, such as edges and textures. However, CNNs can struggle to capture long-range dependencies in images.

Transformers, on the other hand, are a relatively new deep learning architecture that has achieved state-of-the-art results on a variety of natural language processing tasks. Transformers are able to capture long-range dependencies in text sequences through a self-attention mechanism.

Recent research has shown that combining CNNs and transformers can lead to improved performance on medical image processing tasks. For example, the BiTr-Unet model, proposed by Chen et al. (2021), achieved state-of-the-art results on the BraTS brain tumor segmentation challenge. BiTr-Unet combines CNNs and transformers to extract both local and long-range features from MRI images.

Here is a general overview of how a CNN-Transformer model can be used for tumor detection from MRI images:

Preprocessing: The MRI images are first preprocessed to normalize the intensity values and remove any artifacts.
Feature extraction: The preprocessed images are then passed through a CNN to extract features. The CNN can be designed to extract both local and long-range features.
Classification: The extracted features are then passed through a transformer to classify the images as either tumor-bearing or non-tumor-bearing. The transformer can learn to capture long-range dependencies in the features to improve classification performance.
CNN-Transformer models have the potential to revolutionize the way that tumors are detected and diagnosed. By combining the strengths of CNNs and transformers, these models can achieve high accuracy and efficiency on medical image processing tasks.

Here are some of the advantages of using CNN-Transformer models for tumor detection from MRI images:

High accuracy: CNN-Transformer models have been shown to achieve state-of-the-art results on tumor detection and segmentation challenges.
Efficiency: CNN-Transformer models can be trained efficiently on large datasets of MRI images.
Robustness: CNN-Transformer models are robust to noise and other variations in MRI images.
Interpretability: CNN-Transformer models can be made more interpretable using techniques such as attention visualization.
Overall, CNN-Transformer models are a promising new approach for tumor detection from MRI images. They have the potential to improve the accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of tumor detection systems.
